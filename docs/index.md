# About the Project

`Ethereum.nix` is a collection of [Nix](https://nixos.org) packages and [NixOS](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/NixOS_modules) modules
designed to make it easier to operate [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) related services and infrastructure.

## Background

In the beginning `Ethereum.nix` was a playground for [Aldo Borrero](https://aldoborrero.com/) to experiment with _nix'ifying_
Ethereum related processes. Since then, it has a grown into an ever-increasing number of packages and modules targeted towards
streamlining day-to-day operations across a variety of different projects.
